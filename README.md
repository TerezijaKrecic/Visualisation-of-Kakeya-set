# Visualisation-of-Kakeya-set
Visualisation of Kakeya set using app Ipe.

I am currently writing an article of my own on how to construct such a set with arbitrarily small area in which a unit segment can be continuously turned around for 180Â°. The Besicovitch's article from 1963 is rather complicated and I wish to simplify the construction and explaination mentioned within. I am using the app Ipe to construct all the figures on my own. For the time being only the first figure in my article is generated by Geogebra because I didn't know how to dray a deltoid curve in Ipe.
